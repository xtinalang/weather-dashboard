My first weather Dashboard


Get Weather: User can enter a city name and get the current weather.

Tasks:

- [ ] Display a prompt for the user to enter a city name.
    - [ ] Verify that city is actual city. 

- [ ] Use the requests library to make a GET request to the weather API with the city name.

- [ ] Parse the response and display the weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.).

Please note that this application requires using an API to retrieve the weather data, whichÂ involves understanding how to interact with APIs and parse JSON responses.

So you'll have to sign up for a service like OpenWeather to get an API, and work with the requests library to retrieve data from the API.
